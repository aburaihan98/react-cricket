# Cricket

In this project I have used **tailwind css** and **react js**.
While doing this project I faced challenges at several places,

1. Player validation: When the user chooses a player, if the price of that player is more than the coins, then that player will not be added, and no coins will be reduced from the original coin. One player cannot be added more than once and more than 6 players cannot be added.
2. Coin validation: Negative numbers in coins will not be added and after adding a player, the value of that player will be reduced from coins.
3. Adding Conditionally Available and Selected buttons.

### Technologies used.

tailwind css and react js.

### 3 key features of your project.

1. After clicking the Choose Player button, that player will be added to the Selected page.
2. After clicking the elected button will show the selected players.
3. If you want to delete a player on the selected page, click on the delete icon on the right side of that player and that player will be deleted.
